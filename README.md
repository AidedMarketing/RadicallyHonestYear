**A capacity-aware life operating system for a year of radical self-honesty.**

## What This Is

This isn't a habit tracker. It's not about productivity or optimization.

It's a **reflective system** designed for **52 weeks of telling the truth** about where you actually are—your energy, your capacity, your wants, your relationships, your identity.

Built for people who operate with fluctuating capacity. People who have 4-5 good days and 1-2 survival days per week. People for whom "just push through" doesn't work.

**The entire year points toward one document: December 31, 2026.**

*"Here's what I now know is true about my life, my wants, my capacity, my identity—that I couldn't say on January 1, 2026."*

---

## Core Principles

**1. Honesty Before Action**
Tell the truth about where you are before trying to optimize anything.

**2. Systems Over Willpower**
Build structures that work on your worst days, not just your best.

**3. Capacity-Aware Design**
Bad days aren't exceptions—they're included in the plan.

**4. Identity Through Repetition**
Small, honest repetitions compound over 52 weeks.

## What You'll Do

### Weekly Check-In (5 Questions)
Every week, answer the same 5 questions:
1. **Truth Snapshot** - What's actually true this week?
2. **Energy Reality** - Survival / Functional / Capable / Expansive
3. **Commitments Audit** - What you said you'd do, and what happened
4. **One Honest Win** - Can be survival. Must be real.
5. **One True Thing** - A truth to carry into next week

**Low-energy version:** Just Energy + Win. That's it.

### Depth Cycles (9 Optional Themes)
When you're ready for deeper work, explore one of 9 cycles:

**Q1: Foundation**
- What You Consider "Home" Right Now
- Your Relationship With Rest
- The Things You're Afraid to Want

**Q2: Stabilization**
- The Relationships That Hold You
- What Lights You Up (Curiosity + Joy)
- Power Dynamics in Your Everyday Life

**Q3: Expansion**
- Your Personal Mythology
- The Identity You're Slowly Growing Out Of

**Q4: Integration**
- Emotional Echoes

Each cycle has 4 prompts. Go at your own pace. Rest when needed.

### Quarterly Resets
At the end of each quarter, reflect:
- What pattern emerged that you didn't expect?
- What did you consistently avoid?
- What worked unexpectedly well?
- Is your capacity baseline still accurate?
- What needs to shift next quarter?

### Year-End Artifact (December 31, 2026)
The destination the whole year points toward:
- What systems held?
- What changed about how you see yourself?
- What you're now able to say?
- What you now know you want?
- What you're leaving behind?
- What you're carrying forward?
- What you learned about your capacity?
- What surprised you?
- If you could tell January 1, 2026 you one thing, what would it be?

## Common Questions

**Do I have to check in every week?**
No. The system doesn't punish skipping. If you miss weeks, just pick up where you left off.

**What if I forget to export?**
The system reminds you if it's been 7+ days since last export. Heed the reminder.

**Can I change my answers later?**
Yes. You can edit any check-in from the History screen.

**Do I have to do all 9 depth cycles?**
No. Do the ones that call to you. Skip the rest. There's no completion requirement.

**What if I'm in survival mode for weeks?**
Use low-energy mode. Just track Energy + Win. That's enough.

**Where is my data stored?**
On your device, in localStorage. It doesn't leave your browser unless you export it.

**What if I get a new phone?**
Export your data as JSON. Import it on your new device. (This is why regular exports matter.)

## Philosophy: Timeless Inner Work

This system is designed for **who you're becoming**, not crisis management for what's happening now.

Cycles focus on timeless themes:
- Identity
- Relationships
- Rest
- Mythology
- Home
- Joy
- Power dynamics
- Emotional patterns

Not:
- Current job search
- This month's goals
- Productivity hacks
- Habit streaks

The foundation you build this year will serve you for years.
